# External Playback Controls

Playback on the video page is controlled by an external play/pause button in `app/videos/[videoId]/VideoPageShell.tsx`.

## Rules

- The button calls `video.play()` or `video.pause()` through `videoRef`.
- UI state stays event-driven.
- The video element is the source of truth.

## Event Contract

`VideoPlayer` exposes playback lifecycle callbacks:

- `onPlay`
- `onPause`
- `onEnded`

`VideoPageShell` maps them to `isPlaying`.

## Loop selected range

When a comment or draft timeline range is active, playback can repeat between `startSeconds` and `endSeconds`. See `loop-selected-range.md` for target precedence, the **Loop range** toggle, and stop conditions. Loop wrap runs in `onTimeUpdate` and does not change the play/pause event contract above.

## Why

- `video.play()` can reject.
- Event-driven state avoids UI drift.
- `onEnded` resets the button state without extra logic.

## State Mapping

- `onPlay` => `isPlaying = true`
- `onPause` => `isPlaying = false`
- `onEnded` => `isPlaying = false`
